      GUI stands for "Graphical User Interface",is a desktop application through which user can interact with the electronic devices like computer.
      Python provides various frameworks,libraries to implement GUI.
      One of the popular Python GUI library is "Tkinter".We can access different methods by importing "Tkinter" module.
      By using this "Tkinter" module,we can create template for front-end part of a web application.
      And the different widgets I used here are:
        Label
        Button
        Enter
        Messagebox
      And there are other widgets also like 
        Checkbox
        Radiobutton
        Frames
        Scrolledtext
        Combobox
        </pre>
