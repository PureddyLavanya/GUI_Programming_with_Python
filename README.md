  GUI stands for "Graphical User Interface",is a desktop application through which user can interact with the electronic devices like computer.
  Python provides various frameworks,libraries to implement GUI.
  One of the popular Python GUI library is "Tkinter".We can access different methods by importing "Tkinter" module.
  By using this "Tkinter" module,we can create template for front-end part of a web application.
  And the different widgets I used here are:
    Label
    Button
    Enter
    Messagebox
 And there are other widgets also like 
  Checkbox
  Radiobutton
  Frames
  Scrolledtext
  Combobox
